# UserStory

As a cocktail enthusiast,
I want to use an app to build a cocktail that translates ingredients to any language,
So that I can share  it with my ESL friends and family.



1. When I click on the cocktail menu:
- Then I am presented with a list of options (ingredient)

2. When I click on the language menu:
- Then I am presented with a list of google translate languages

3. When I select a language:
- Then I am presented with the translated cocktail (information)
