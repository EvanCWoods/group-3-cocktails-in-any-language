# Description

Everyone enjoys a good cocktail and many people love sharing their interests on social media. At times, it can be difficult to share interests in a multicultural and world wide platform. This application allows users to share their favourite cocktails with their friends regardless of language.  

The basic concept of this application is to allow the user to search for a cocktail and be provided with an ingredient list and directions. The user can then search for a language to translate the recipe to share with their ESL friends or family. This application utilizes the Cocktail DB API and the translator API from the Rapid API marketplace.
